We slightly modified our input, since we thought it would be more user friendly to just type in
the fields (which are still in the algebraic chess notation). There was a question in the forum
regarding using different input methods and it said as long as we add a read me to the project it would be fine.

We prompt the user twice for input per turn. Example:

[Player], choose a valid field of a figure 
b2
[Player], Enter the field where you want to move your figure: 
b4
