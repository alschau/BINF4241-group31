ReadMe  

Cleaning Robot:  
The cleaning robot has battery for 100 seconds and charges from 0% to 100% in 10 seconds.
The "outstanding cleaning" command will give lots of prints that we couldn't get rid of in the given time.

Threads:  
We used 4 different kinds of threads. (We probaly could have done it with 2.) We've decided to use 3 threads especially for
the cleaning robot to make it simpler and more understandable for us and everyone reading it.

- MyThread: used for the timer in oven, dishwasher, microwave and washing machine.
- MyBatteryThread: used for the Battery Percentage of the cleaning robot.
- mychargerthread: used for the Charging Percentage of the cleaning robot.
- MyTimerThread: used for the Cleaning Completion of the cleaning robot.
